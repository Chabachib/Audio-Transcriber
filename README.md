# 🎤 Audio Transcriber

I love rapping, but sometimes the songs I listen to don’t have lyrics available online. I got tired of this, since I like to rap along. That’s what inspired me to create an **audio transcriber**!

The idea is simple:  
1. Download the song audio from YouTube.  
2. Transcribe it using **fast-whisper** (I chose this because it's much faster than the classic Whisper model).  
3. Enjoy rapping along with your favorite tracks!

When I want to run this, I usually use Kaggle with a good GPU to make the process even faster.

## 🚀 How to Run the Notebook

1. Download the notebook file: **`audio_transcriber.ipynb`**.
2. Go to the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/).
3. Click on **`Create` → `Import Notebook` → `Upload the notebook`**.
4. Execute the cells and wait for your transcription to finish! 😊

⚠️ **Note:**  
There is no strict limit to the number of songs you can transcribe. However, to avoid any bot detection issues (even if you’re not a bot), I recommend processing a maximum of **5 audios per batch**. I don’t have an exact threshold, but 5 should keep you safe.

Happy transcribing and happy rapping! 🎧✨
