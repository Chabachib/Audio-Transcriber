# 🎤 Audio Transcriber

I love rapping, but sometimes the songs I listen to don’t have lyrics available online. I got tired of this, since I like to rap along. That’s what inspired me to create an **audio transcriber**!

The idea is simple:  
1. Download the song audio from YouTube.  
2. Transcribe it using **fast-whisper** (I chose this because it's much faster than the classic Whisper model).  
3. Enjoy rapping along with your favorite tracks!

When I want to run this, I usually use Kaggle with a good GPU to make the process even faster.

## 💡 About the Notebook

This notebook is designed for **general audio transcription**, so you can use it to transcribe **any kind of audio you want** — not just songs.  

My main motivation was to get **rap lyrics**, but feel free to use it for podcasts, interviews, speeches, or any audio files you need transcribed!

2. Go to the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/).
3. Click on **`Create` → `Import Notebook` → `Upload the notebook`**.
4. Execute the cells and wait for your transcription to finish! 😊

## 💬 Getting Your Lyrics or Transcript

After the transcription is done, you will find a **text file** containing the lyrics or transcript in the **output folder**.  
Just refresh the folder view, and you will see the file there.  
Then, simply download it and start enjoying your text! 🎶📝

## ⚠️ **Note:**  
There is no strict limit to the number of audios you can transcribe. However, to avoid any bot detection issues (even if you’re not a bot), I recommend processing a maximum of **5 audios per batch**. I don’t have an exact threshold, but 5 should keep you safe.

Happy Transcribing and Happy Rapping (or Listening)! 🎧✨
